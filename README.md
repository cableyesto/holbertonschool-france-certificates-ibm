## Partnership and Certifications
ðŸ’¡ Thanks to its partnership with IBM, Holberton France gives you the opportunity to earn technical certifications online through IBMâ€™s E-Learning platform. In this certification program, there are mandatory certificates you must obtain and optional ones that we recommend to enhance your resume and stand out to recruiters.

- Once you obtain a certificate, you must upload it to the specified GitHub repository as directed in the tasks, in the correct folder, with the correct file name (in image format). You must also share the link to your certificate, if applicable!
- Certificate verification and scoring must be carried out by your SWE.
- When you obtain a certificate, please ask your local SWE to verify it and to manually review your project.
